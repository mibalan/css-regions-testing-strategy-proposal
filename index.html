      <p>
        This document is intended to be used as a guideline for the testing
        activities related to the CSS Regions spec [[!css3-regions]]. Its main
        goal is to provide an overview of the general testing areas, possible
        caveats and testing aspects not immediately apparent from the spec.
        Also, it provides a means of tracking the progress of the CSS Regions
        spec testing.
      </p>
      <p>
        This document is not meant to replace the spec in determining the 
        normative and non-normative assertions to be tested, but rather
        complement it.
      </p>
    </section>
    
    <section>
      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        As CSS moved away from the monolithical development of CSS 2.1 to the 
        modular development of CSS 3, the number of proposed new features and
        the complexity of the layout landscape have increased dramatically.
        While this directly translates to increased flexibility and agility in
        adopting and implementing new CSS features, it also increases the
        complexity of testing CSS features and the need for coordinating the
        testing efforts. Also, the need for testing coordination increases as
        crowd-sourcing efforts like
        <a href="http://testthewebforward.org/" target="_blank">Test the Web
        Forward</a> present people less familiar with the processes and policies
        of the W3C with the opportunity to contribute new tests.
      </p>
      <p>
        Except when defining new behaviors or redefining old behaviors, the
        implicit assumption for new CSS modules is that they play nicely with
        other modules or properties defined in CSS 2.1 [[CSS21]]. As CSS Regions
        is a spec that touches many aspects of layout, styling and CSSOM, it's
        not unreasonable to want to test the spec against these implicit
        assumptions, too.
      </p>
      <p>
        The main goal of this testing strategy document is to complement the
        existing test suite &ndash; the test suite contains the existing tests,
        while the testing strategy provides an overview of what should be done,
        both normatively defined in the CSS Regions spec and inferred from other
        specs or aspects of the current spec. It also lists a desired general
        approach to testing CSS Regions and the priorities in doing so.
      </p>
      <p>
        Lastly, this document contains a tracker for the progress of the testing
        effort for CSS Regions. While the most up-to-date reference remains the
        actual test suite, the test progress tracker will be kept as up-to-date
        as possible, in order to accurately present the areas that still need
        testing. Note that this only refers to W3C tests and might not include
        testing done by implementors (unless it's been upstreamed to the W3C).
      </p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Approach</h2>
      <p>
        - testing the spec cannot be entirely separated from testing an implementation
        - it's a complex spec, so multiple passes will be needed - each going deeper in some aspects
        - general points to keep in mind
          - at each pass, get most bang for the buck
          - try to be as automation friendly as possible
            - ref-tests/testharness.js tests
            - keep manual tests to a minimum
            - where manual tests are absolutely required, try to design them with possible future automation in mind; there are efforts to enable testing with WebDriver [[webdriver]]
      </p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Goals</h2>
      <p>
        - be as automation-friendly as possible
          - side-goal is to play nicely with implementors automation tools/suites, so that they can contribute as much as possible to the W3C testing effort
          - see above about ref-tests/testharness.js over manual tests
        - provide guidance on areas' testing needs (what needs how much testing, caveats, etc.)
        - enable contributions from the community (other implementors, non-affiliated ppl)
        - "layered" testing, spec tests should be usable to get an idea of the level of support in a certain implementation
      </p>

        <h3>Risks and mitigation</h3>
        <section>
          <h4>Risks</h4>
          <p>
            - implicit interactions with a lot of other spec
              - some are in CSSWG (flexbox, grid, etc.)
              - some are in "fluid" specs (e.h. HTML5) or non-CSSWG (ShadowDOM)
            - (supposed) big number of tests needed
              - TODO ask Rebecca about spec coverage reports
          </p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h4>Mitigation</h4>
          <p>
            - for mature specs, try to make the two play nice together, for less mature specs, try to be future proof, raise concerns, but don't try to cater for everything (must draw a line)
            - see goal about test coordination and enabling easy test contribution

      <h2>Testing areas</h2>
      <p>List of the testing areas, implicit and explicit.</p>
      <section>
        <h3>Explicit testing areas</h3>
        <p>These are testing areas normatively defined by the spec. They cover things explicitly or implicitly defined in the CSS Regions spec.</p>
        <p></p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3>Implicit testing areas</h3>
        <p>These are testing areas either normatively defined in other specs
          that explicitly refer to the CSS Regions spec (e.g. [[!css3-break]])
          or simply not explicitly defined, but implied by various aspects of
          the spec (e.g. processing model, CSS 2.1 compliance, etc.).</p>
